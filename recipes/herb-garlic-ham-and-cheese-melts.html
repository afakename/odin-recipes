    <h1>Herb-Garlic Ham & Cheese Melts</h1>
    <img src="../images/ham-and-cheese-sliders.jpg" alt="Herb-garlic Ham and Cheese sliders image">
        <p>When you want a savory snack to feed a family during the holidays, this perfect finger food will be sure to please.
        I first had these at a Christmas gathering and it was so amazing that I almost ate the entire pan.  Even after having a full sampler plate of everything else being served.
        The five flavors put together make for a mouth watering melty happy dance.
    </p>
    <p>These little sliders can be made really quick and are just the perfect little meal or even could qualify as a light snack.
        It is highly suggested you add this to your next potluck.
